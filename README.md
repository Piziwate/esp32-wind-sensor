# esp32-wind-sensor
This small project aims to create a PCB and a mongoose-os application with an ESP32 in order to add a Wifi connectivity to the BeckerÂ© SC81 anemometer. The PCB replaces the original one in order to facilitate the assembly. It is thus possible to connect this system to a Shelly outdoor blind controller for example.
